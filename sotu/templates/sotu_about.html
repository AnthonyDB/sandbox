            <p>This is a demo of PostgreSQL's <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html">full-text search</a> features. 
                It uses the <code>websearch_to_tsquery()</code> function, which converts user input to a <code>tsquery</code> value and allows
            additional user controls. For example, placing words in quotes allows for adjacency queries. A minus sign allows for exclusion of a word.</p>
            <p>The database contains more than 80 speeches made by U.S. presidents to Congress from 1946 to 2023. Most are "State of the Union" speeches typically delivered at the beginning of the year.</p>
